\section{Introduction}

From the time when Block 0 of the Bitcoin blockchain, the Genesis Block, is created at 
18:15:05 GMT on January 3rd, 2009, the words ``cryptocurrencies'' and ``Blockchain'' become one of the most 
popular fields in information technology. The ``decentralized'' and ``anonymous'' nature 
of cryptocurrencies overcomes the weakness of traditional \textit{trust-based} 
electronic payments who relies heavily on trusted third-party financial institutions. The 
\textit{cryptographic proof-of-work} of bitcoin enables reliable transaction between 
two parties directly. Through almost 10 years development, cryptocurrencies turns out to be 
a large family and can be deployed onto multiple devices.

Though bitcoin give a great solution on \textit{double spending} problem, it doesn't 
mean that it is secured in all aspects. One possible issue is balance attack targeting 
blockchain's forkable feature. Other cryptocurrencies allowing forkable chains all suffer 
from the very same issue. In this sense, unfokable blockchain is proven to solve this problem. 
On the other hand, another possible solution to secure transaction is 
to adopt mechanism like \textit{zero knowledge contingent payment} which are released if 
and only if some knowledge is disclosed by the payee and to do this in a trustless manner 
where neither the payer or payee can cheat. Whilst there are several theoretical discussion 
and practice in a variety of contexts, this paper will concentrate on their application on 
cryptocurrencies blockchain, especially on mobile devices.

\subsection{Blockchain}

Blockchain is the way how Bitcoin keeps its public ledger. To some 
extent, blockchain is simply a peer-to-peer distributed timestamp 
server. The ultimate goal of this design is to solve /textit{double-spending} 
problems and prevent modification of transaction records.

Each full node in the Bitcoin network keeps a full copy of the blockchain, 
in which all blocks validated by this particular is stored. When 
several nodes within the network independently arrive at identical 
blockchains, they are considered to be in \textit{consensus}.

As its name suggests, a blockchain is a digital chain of blocks, where 
a timestamp, a nonce, and a Merkle Tree is stored.  The blocks are chained 
cryptographically using hash. In detail, each block contains the hash of its 
previous block ,finally leading to the Genesis Block. Any modification on 
blocks in the chain would violates all subsequent hashes, which is vital for 
consistency of the ledger. Figure \ref{fig:blockchain} shows part of a blockchain.

However, computing a hash is expensive. This truth enables the adoption of 
\textit{proof-of-work} in bitcoin network.
